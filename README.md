# fauxnews

Summer project (YYGS Frontiers of Science and Technology 2019) to mockup the potential harms of algorithmically-generated fake news. 
Utilizes Markov chains and dataset of The Onion headlines to either organically generate headlines or generate headlines based on user-given tags.

_N.B.: Since these headlines are directly scraped from the Onion, some are not appropriate -- use with caution!_
